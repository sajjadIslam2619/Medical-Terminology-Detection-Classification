SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES . OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES : <Test> Echocardiogram </Test>  times two . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with <Problem-present> metastatic cervical cancer </Problem-present>  admitted with a question of <Problem-possible> malignant pericardial effusion </Problem-possible>  . Patient underwent <Treatment> a total abdominal hysterectomy </Treatment>  in 02 / 90 for a 4x3 . 6x2 cm <Problem-present> cervical mass </Problem-present>  felt to be a fibroid at Vanor . Pathology revealed <Problem-present> poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the </Problem-present>  cervix with spots of vaginal margins and <Problem-present> metastatic squamous cell carcinoma </Problem-present>  in the cardinal ligaments with extensive <Problem-present> lymphatic </Problem-present>  invasion . Patient was felt to have <Problem-present> stage 2B disease </Problem-present>  and post - operatively , she was treated with <Treatment> intracavitary </Treatment>  and <Treatment> external beam radiation therapy </Treatment>  and <Treatment> low </Treatment>  dose <Treatment> Cisplatin </Treatment>  . On <Test> ultrasound </Test>  in 02 / 91 , the patient was found to have <Problem-present> bilateral cystic adnexal masses </Problem-present>  confirmed on <Test> physical examination </Test>  . She underwent <Test> exploratory laparotomy </Test>  and had <Treatment> a bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy </Treatment>  and <Treatment> appendectomy </Treatment>  . <Test> Pathology </Test>  was negative for <Problem-absent> tumor </Problem-absent>  and showed <Problem-present> peritubal </Problem-present>  and <Problem-present> periovarian adhesions </Problem-present>  . The patient now presents with a three to four week history of <Problem-present> shortness of breath </Problem-present>  and <Problem-present> a dry non - productive cough </Problem-present>  . She was evaluated by Dr . Mielke , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be <Problem-present> wheezing </Problem-present>  and performed <Test> pulmonary function tests </Test>  which showed an <Test> FEV1 </Test>  of 1 . 1 and an FVC of 1 . 8 . She was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible <Problem-possible> asthma </Problem-possible>  . Room air arterial blood gas showed <Test> a </Test>  <Test> pO2 </Test>  of 56 , <Test> a pCO2 </Test>  of 35 , and <Test> a pH </Test>  of 7 . 52 . <Test> EKG </Test>  showed <Problem-present> sinus tachycardia </Problem-present>  at 100 and <Test> echo </Test>  revealed <Problem-present> pericardial effusion </Problem-present>  , <Problem-present> a 10 </Problem-present>  mm <Problem-present> pulsus paradoxus </Problem-present>  was noted , and no evidence of tamponade . Given the patient & apos ; s history of <Problem-present> cervical cancer </Problem-present>  , <Problem-present> the pericardial effusion </Problem-present>  was felt most likely to be malignant . She was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for <Treatment> further care </Treatment>  . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY : 02 / 90 , <Treatment> total abdominal hysterectomy </Treatment>  complicated by <Treatment> ureteral </Treatment>  <Problem-present> transection </Problem-present>  with <Treatment> right ureteral tube </Treatment>  placed for six weeks , <Treatment> stent tube </Treatment>  placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for <Problem-present> a hydronephrosis </Problem-present>  post , in 03 / 91 , <Treatment> bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy </Treatment>  and <Treatment> appendectomy </Treatment>  . CURRENT MEDICATIONS : <Treatment> Prednisone </Treatment>  20 mg p . o . q . a . m . with 10 mg p . o . q . p . m . , <Treatment> Uniphyl </Treatment>  400 mg p . o . q . d . , <Treatment> Augmentin </Treatment>  250 p . o . t . i . d . , <Treatment> Estrase </Treatment>  2 mg p . o . q . d . , <Treatment> MS Contin </Treatment>  30 mg q . 12h . , and <Treatment> Morphine </Treatment>  p . r . n . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Emaciated white female in <Problem-present> mild respiratory distress </Problem-present>  . <Test> Temperature </Test>  was 98 . 1 , <Test> heart rate </Test>  116 , <Test> blood pressure </Test>  120 / 68 , and room air <Test> O2 saturation </Test>  was 93 % . HEENT : Dry mucous membranes and <Problem-present> myotic </Problem-present>  pupils . NECK : No <Problem-absent> lymphadenopathy </Problem-absent>  . CHEST : <Problem-present> Few </Problem-present>  <Problem-present> inspiratory wheezes </Problem-present>  and no <Problem-absent> rhonchi </Problem-absent>  . HEART : Regular rate and rhythm with <Problem-present> tachycardia </Problem-present>  and no <Problem-absent> rubs </Problem-absent>  or <Problem-absent> murmur </Problem-absent>  . ABDOMEN : Well healed Pfannenstiel scars and no <Problem-absent> masses </Problem-absent>  . PELVIC : No <Problem-absent> masses </Problem-absent>  . RECTAL : No <Problem-absent> masses </Problem-absent>  and guaiac negative . EXTREMITIES : No <Problem-absent> edema </Problem-absent>  or <Problem-absent> cyanosis </Problem-absent>  . LABORATORY EXAMINATION : <Test> Hematocrit </Test>  was 40 , <Test> white count </Test>  was 21 , and <Test> platelet count </Test>  of 723 , 000 . <Test> PT </Test>  and <Test> PTT </Test>  were 12 and 26 . <Test> Electrolytes </Test>  were within normal limits , <Test> liver function </Test>  tests within normal limits , and <Test> EKG </Test>  showed a <Test> heart rate </Test>  of 128 , axis 73 , and possible <Problem-possible> ectopic </Problem-possible>  P . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted for <Problem-present> a new pericardial effusion </Problem-present>  which was felt most likely to be secondary to <Problem-present> metastatic cervical cancer </Problem-present>  . There was no evidence of <Problem-absent> tamponade </Problem-absent>  . <Test> An echocardiogram </Test>  was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted . <Test> Echocardiogram </Test>  showed <Problem-present> moderate anterior pericardial effusion </Problem-present>  of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and <Problem-present> low </Problem-present>  velocity <Problem-present> paradox </Problem-present>  . Cardiology did not feel that <Problem-possible> tamponade </Problem-possible>  at this time was a concern and that <Test> a tap </Test>  need not be performed . She continued to have <Problem-present> pulmonary wheezing </Problem-present>  , unknown origin , without history of <Problem-absent> asthma </Problem-absent>  . <Treatment> Her steroids </Treatment>  were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended <Test> a CT scan of the chest </Test>  to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for <Test> CBC </Test>  , arterial <Test> blood </Test>  gas , continuing of <Treatment> the beta agonist inhalers </Treatment>  , and trial of <Treatment> steroid inhalers </Treatment>  . They felt it was most likely <Problem-possible> a malignant lymphangitic spread </Problem-possible>  with <Problem-possible> pericardial involvement </Problem-possible>  versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or <Problem-possible> viral bronchiolitis </Problem-possible>  . She had <Test> pulmonary function tests </Test>  repeated which showed an <Test> FEV1 </Test>  of 36 % of predicted and <Test> FVC </Test>  of 56 % of predicted . Room air arterial blood gas showed a <Test> pH </Test>  of 7 . 45 , <Test> pO2 </Test>  of 63 , <Test> a pCO2 </Test>  of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient . She was continued on two liters of <Treatment> oxygen </Treatment>  awaiting <Test> her CT scan </Test>  on 06 / 14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of <Problem-possible> a new rub </Problem-possible>  versus <Problem-possible> murmur </Problem-possible>  on <Test> examination </Test>  . Cardiology felt she had <Problem-present> a rub </Problem-present>  and her pulsus was still 10 . <Test> EKG </Test>  showed <Problem-present> an </Problem-present>  ectopic <Problem-present> low atrial </Problem-present>  P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of <Problem-absent> tamponade </Problem-absent>  . She should have <Test> a follow - up echocardiogram </Test>  . <Test> Echocardiogram </Test>  showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , <Problem-present> moderate to mild effusion </Problem-present>  with <Problem-present> pericardial pressures </Problem-present>  exceeding right atrial pressures , and <Problem-present> right ventricular pressures </Problem-present>  at various points of patient & apos ; s cycle without any change in <Problem-present> the effusion </Problem-present>  from 06 / 11 . Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for <Treatment> a pericardial window </Treatment>  at the time . She should be continued with <Test> pulmonary oximetry </Test>  testing . She underwent <Test> her CT scan </Test>  . This showed <Problem-present> lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest </Problem-present>  , question of <Problem-possible> pulmonary nodules in the chest </Problem-possible>  , <Problem-present> pericardial effusion </Problem-present>  , <Problem-present> multiple liver metastases </Problem-present>  , <Problem-present> decreased function of the left kidney </Problem-present>  , <Problem-present> dilated left intrarenal collecting system </Problem-present>  and proximal <Problem-present> ureter </Problem-present>  , and <Problem-present> periaortic lymphadenopathy </Problem-present>  . Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with <Problem-present> lymphangitic spread </Problem-present>  and they did not feel that <Test> a bronchoscopy </Test>  would be of any assistance at this time . <Treatment> Chemotherapy </Treatment>  for <Problem-present> metastatic cervical cancer </Problem-present>  was discussed with the patient and she was started on <Treatment> 5 - FU </Treatment>  800 mg per meter squared days 06 / 18 , 06 / 19 , and 06 / 20 . She also received <Treatment> Cisplatin </Treatment>  35 per meter squared on 06 / 19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06 / 18 . She was noted , on 06 / 16 , to have <Problem-present> numerous erythematous maculopapules </Problem-present>  on her back and chest . Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely <Problem-possible> steroid acne </Problem-possible>  . They therefore felt <Treatment> a rapid steroid taper </Treatment>  was indicated and topical <Treatment> Erythromycin </Treatment>  if desired by the patient . The <Problem-present> patient </Problem-present>  & apos ; s <Problem-present> shortness of breath </Problem-present>  and <Problem-present> wheezing </Problem-present>  continued but without change . <Test> Her cardiac examination </Test>  remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of <Problem-absent> tamponade </Problem-absent>  . Cardiology felt that <Test> follow - up echo </Test>  was indicated on 06 / 18 as she had <Test> another echocardiogram </Test>  which showed no change or evidence of <Problem-absent> tamponade </Problem-absent>  . They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by <Test> examination </Test>  . She had <Problem-present> some mental status changes </Problem-present>  with <Problem-present> confusion </Problem-present>  and <Problem-present> hallucinations </Problem-present>  on 06 / 18 originating from <Treatment> narcotics </Treatment>  versus <Problem-possible> decreased pO2 </Problem-possible>  . The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated <Problem-present> the mental status changes </Problem-present>  and that she was to receive no further Ifex . She had no <Problem-absent> further hallucinations </Problem-absent>  since stopping the Ifex . Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with <Problem-present> the </Problem-present>  changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis . She was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for <Problem-present> symptoms </Problem-present>  of <Problem-present> anxiety </Problem-present>  . She continued to have no change in <Problem-present> her shortness of breath </Problem-present>  or <Test> cardiac examination </Test>  and was discharged home on 06 / 22 / 91 after completing <Treatment> her 5 - FU </Treatment>  and <Treatment> Cisplatin chemotherapy </Treatment>  . DISPOSITION : She will be followed by Dr . Mielke and home care services .
